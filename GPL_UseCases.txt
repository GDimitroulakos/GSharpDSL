1) Chaining To algorithms

Algorithm1( initialize algorithm with name function arguments).
After().
Aglorithm2(initialize algorithm with name function arguments)

Example 
Subset Construction  E-Closure(Move(q,c))

AMove(Graph = g, Transitions=key, Node = q, Char = c).
After().
AEclosure(Set = , Graph = g, Transitions = key)


AMove algorithms requires:
1) The graph
2) The Transition edges and their characters
3) A Node to apply the move operation
4) A alphabet character
